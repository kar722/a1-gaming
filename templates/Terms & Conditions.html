            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Earning Points</h3>
        <p>Points are earned at the time of purchase when a Member provides or scans their A1 Gaming ID at stores. If a Member is signed into their Membership when ordering online or provides their A1 Gaming ID when placing an order at an ACo store, points will be earned at the time of shipment. Only one (1) A1 Gaming ID can be used per transaction.</p>
        <p>Members earn points for every net dollar spent (including using gift cards as tender on purchases) on any Eligible Product Purchases (as defined below). Net dollars spent is the amount spent on an Eligible Product Purchase, excluding the use of merchandise credit as tender and minus the costs specified below on point calculations.</p>
        <p>All product purchases (excluding purchases of gift cards and e-gift cards) earn one hundred (100) points for every net dollar spent in store or online. Points earned will be rounded to the nearest whole cent.</p>
        <p>A1 Gaming may identify additional opportunities for Members to earn points from time to time. For example, those tasks may include the following:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>
                Share details on Member profile. Points may be awarded for each additional detail provided with a Membership profile (details which qualify to earn points will be indicated within A1 Gaming, but will not include name, phone, or email address as those were required fields for Membership creation). However, points will only be awarded once per lifetime of each Membership.
            </li>
            <li>
                Initial Membership sign-in on App. Points may be awarded for the initial sign-in to a A1 Gaming Membership on the App after the first App download. However, points will only be awarded once per lifetime of each Membership.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Points will post to the corresponding A1 Gaming Membership within approximately forty eight hours (48) hours from in-store purchase or date of online or store order shipment. If Members do not identify themselves at time of purchase, a manual adjustment can be made to add the points to the A1 Gaming Membership for up to thirty (30) days from the actual purchase date, but no purchases prior to the launch of this new benefit can be added. Please see the "History" section of Membership for instructions on how to do this.</p>
        <p>Point calculations are based upon dollars spent at checkout on Eligible Product Purchases. "Eligible Product Purchases" means purchases of ACo, Gilly Hicks, and Social Tourist products such as clothing, accessories, and personal care items such as fragrance. The following costs are excluded from point calculation of Eligible Product Purchases: sales tax, state fees, shipping &amp; handling or delivery charges, gift wrap fees, and purchase of gift cards or e-gift cards. Also, Members do not earn points for the amount of any coupon, discounts, or merchandise credit applied to purchases, as well as the value of any Certificate being redeemed. ACo has the right to make the final decision on whether any product purchase qualifies for points.</p>
        <p>When Members return products to the store or return online purchases by mail, points previously posted for that purchase will be deducted from the point balance of the A1 Gaming Membership provided at the time of purchase. If a Member's point balance is insufficient to cover a deduction related to a return, the Members' point balance may go into the negative, and any Membership reaching into a negative balance is subject to be suspended from all further activity at the discretion of ACo. Members with a suspended account will need to reach ACo's Customer Service Department to seek reinstatement. If an account has a negative balance, all earned points will apply first to the negative balance before a Member may begin earning points eligible for conversion to a Certificate.</p>
        <p>Points are property of ACo, have no cash value, and are not transferable to anyone else or any other Membership in any capacity for any reason. Unused points will expire twelve (12) months after they have been issued. Points that remain on a A1 Gaming Membership will also expire as indicated and are forfeited if A1 Gaming is terminated or the A1 Gaming Membership is closed. Points may not be combined among Members.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Base Rewards</h3>
        <p>When Members reach various point thresholds as outlined below, they will automatically have those points converted into a Certificate redeemable for money off their purchase at an ACo store or A1D0Co.com.</p>

            <h4>Gold Status Qualification</h4>
            <p>A1 Gaming Members will qualify for Gold Status when they spend $300 in a calendar year. "Calendar Year" is defined as the one-year period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. Gold Status is good for the Calendar Year in which you qualify, and the following Calendar Year. To maintain your Gold Status, you must re-qualify every Calendar Year. In the event you return a purchase which qualified you for Gold Status, the point value of the return will be deducted from your Membership account and you could lose your Gold Status.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Certificates</h3>
        <p>Certificates are valid only in the U.S. in stores and online. Not valid outside the U.S. or at San Francisco Premium Outlet, Katy Mills Mega Outlet, Gurnee Mills Mega Outlet, and Mall of San Juan stores. Certificate expiration dates will vary. Check your Certificate for exact expiration date. Certificate applies pre-tax or state fee and cannot be used for purchases of gift cards, e-gift cards, shipping &amp; handling or delivery charges, and gift wrap. Certificate cannot be applied to previous purchases. Certificate must be presented/entered at time of purchase in stores or online. Discount will be applied at checkout to all eligible items and will be deducted upon return of any item to which the discount was applied. Certificates may be used in conjunction with other Certificates (as limited below) and most other discounts or offers toward the purchase of products, for a discount up to the total purchase amount. If the purchase total is less than the value of the Certificate(s) being used, any unused portion of any given Certificate's value is forfeited. There is a limit of three (3) Certificates per transaction. Certificates constitute a discount from your purchase amount and shall not be considered tender. Certificates are not redeemable for cash or store credit. Certificates are non-transferable and not for resale. Certificates are valid for one (1) time use only. Lost, stolen, or expired Certificates will not be replaced.</p>
        <p>Certificates will be posted to A1 Gaming Memberships within approximately twenty four (24) hours after points are converted into a Certificate. Based on the Certificate value reached, the corresponding amount of points will be deducted from the A1 Gaming Membership balance for every Certificate issued. Certificates should be available for use soon after Member has received Certificates. Once points have been converted into a Certificate, they cannot be converted back into points even if the Certificate is never redeemed and expired.</p>
        <p>Members may earn up to a maximum of one million (1,000,000) points per Calendar Year. Therefore as an example, Members in good standing may earn up to a maximum of eighty (80) $5 Certificates per Calendar Year, forty (40) $10 Certificates per Calendar Year, roughly twenty-six (26) $15 Certificates per Calendar Year, twenty(20) $20 Certificates per Calendar Year, or other various combinations of different Certificates values.</p>
        <p>Certificates are property of ACo, have no cash value, and are not transferable to anyone else or any other Membership in any capacity for any reason. Unused Certificates that remain on A1 Gaming Memberships expire as indicated and are forfeited if A1 Gaming is terminated or the A1 Gaming Membership is closed. ACo is not responsible for lost Certificates, including due to change of email address, or other contact information.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>E-Mail Communication</h3>
        <p>Upon signing up for Membership in A1 Gaming, individuals will sign up to receive emails regarding special Members only offers and events, as well as new features of A1 Gaming. A1 Gaming emails would be in addition to brand marketing emails from ACo, Gilly Hicks, and Social Tourist (should Member be otherwise signed up to receive these general marketing emails). Furthermore, Members who scan or provide their A1 Gaming ID at the store with a purchase will automatically receive an e-receipt confirmation at the email address listed in the A1 Gaming Membership. E-receipts are neither ACo brand marketing nor A1 Gaming Membership emails, but merely confirmations of store purchases.</p><p>
    </p><p>ACo brand marketing emails (including Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist) and A1 Gaming marketing emails will include an opt-out link should individuals no longer want to receive any of these types of emails. Even if a Member opts-out of marketing emails, if the A1 Gaming Membership is still active, Members will continue to receive relationship/operational emails related to A1 Gaming unless the A1 Gaming Membership is cancelled. Individuals do not need to cancel their A1 Gaming Membership to opt-out from receiving ACo brand marketing emails, A1 Gaming marketing emails, or e-receipt emails.</p>
        <p>Members can opt-out of receiving e-receipts from a store purchase by emailing the request to <a href="mailto:A1D0co@A1D0co.com">A1D0co@A1D0co.com</a> from the email address associated with the A1 Gaming Membership. Members can opt-out of receiving A1 Gaming marketing and ACo brand marketing emails (including Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist) by going to the <a href="/shop/Unsubscribe?storeId=10251&amp;catalogId=10201&amp;langId=-1" target="_blank">Unsubscribe</a> page and entering the email address associated with the A1 Gaming Membership or ACo brand marketing email subscription, or by clicking the unsubscribe link contained in the footer of any of these emails, or by updating their marketing preferences in the A1 Gaming account profile.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Cancellation of A1 Gaming Membership</h3>
        <p>We don't think anyone will want to stop getting the great benefits of A1 Gaming, but Members who decide they want to cancel their A1 Gaming Membership can use the Contact Us section of the <a href="/shop/us/help" target="_blank">Help Page</a> and include the email address of the A1 Gaming membership they wish to cancel.</p>
        <p>Cancellation of a A1 Gaming Membership cancels the Member's entire account on A1D0Co.com. If a Member decides to cancel their A1 Gaming Membership, all unused A1 Gaming points and Certificates will be cancelled. If the Member subsequently signs up to become a Member again we will not reinstate the previously cancelled, unused A1 Gaming points or Certificates.</p>
        <p>If a Member chooses to cancel their A1 Gaming Membership but has separately signed up for ACo brand marketing emails, the Member will be opting out of both A1 Gaming marketing and ACo brand marketing emails. Cancelling the A1 Gaming Membership will also cancel e-receipts, unless the Member independently opts to receive e-receipts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>

            <li>
                <p class="large-bold-text">For purposes of this limitation of liability provision, "ACo" includes not only A1D0 Co., but also its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors and assigns, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.</p>

            <li>
                <p class="large-bold-text">Except as expressly provided in this agreement, in no event shall ACo be liable to you or to any third party for any damages arising or resulting from the use of any Certificate by someone other than the A1 Gaming Member to whom the Certificate was sent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="large-bold-text">In no event shall ACo be liable to you or to any third party for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including but not limited to lost profits or business opportunities), regardless of the legal theory, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable, and regardless of whether ACo was advised to the possibility of such damages.</p>

            <li>
                <p class="large-bold-text">Notwithstanding the foregoing, these limitations of liability shall not apply to injuries: (1) to the body or person; or (2) caused by ACo's willful, malicious, reckless, or grossly negligent acts or omissions.</p>

            <li>
                <p class="large-bold-text">These limitations of liability shall survive the termination of this agreement.

                        This arbitration provision shall be interpreted broadly. "Dispute" means any claim or controversy between you and ACo, including but not limited to any: (1) claims for relief or theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, statute or otherwise, or that relate to the existence of this Agreement; (2) claims that arose before this or any Agreement; (3) claims that may arise in the future, including claims that may arise after the cancelation or expiration of this Agreement; and (4) claims that are the subject of a putative class action in which no class has been certified. "Dispute" does not, however, include any issues arising from or relating to the arbitrability of any Disputes under this provision or the scope, validity, or enforceability of this arbitration provision. For purposes of the Dispute Resolution section, "ACo" means Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc., A1D0 Co., and any of their predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, vendors and independent contractors, and each of their officers, directors, employees and agents.

                        This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be heard and determined by a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively the "AAA Rules") as modified by the version of this arbitration provision that is in effect when notice of a Dispute is given. The AAA Rules can be obtained from the AAA by visiting its website (<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>) or calling its toll-free number (<a href="tel:18007787879">1-800-778-7879</a>). If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the rest of this Agreement, this arbitration provision will govern. If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the AAA Rules, this arbitration provision will govern. If the AAA will not administer an arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, you and ACo will agree on (or if necessary petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint) an arbitration organization that will do so. Unless you and ACo agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in the county where you reside. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and will issue a reasoned written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions.

                    <li>
                        If your proceeding is designated by AAA as part of a "Multiple Consumer Case Filing," then you agree: (1) to personally appear and participate in an initial telephone conference with AAA and/or the arbitrator at ACo's request and at any hearing (with your counsel if you are represented); and (2) that the adjudication of your Dispute might await the resolution of other individual claims that are also part of this mass filing.

                        Payment of filing and other fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that the proceeding itself, the substance of a claim or counterclaim, and/or the relief sought in connection with the arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standard set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)), either party will have the right to recover its fees and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees and arbitration fees and costs. In making this determination, the arbitrator may consider, among other things, whether a party previously offered full relief to the other party, including, but not limited to, a full refund of the sum paid for items purchased and whether the arbitration is part of "Multiple Consumer Case Filings" as determined by AAA.

Unless both you and ACo otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claim, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, joint, collective, or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief (including any declaratory or injunctive relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court determines that the class action and collective relief waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a claim for public injunctive relief) and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that the particular claim or request for relief (such as a claim for public injunctive relief) may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.
